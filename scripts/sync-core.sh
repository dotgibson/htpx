# THE MAINTAIN BUTTON.
#
# After you change Core (here, in dotfiles-core) and push, run this to pull the
# update into every OS repo's vendored core/ subtree. Replaces the old N-way
# manual reconciliation with one mechanical loop.
#
# Assumes:
#   - all OS repos are cloned as siblings under one parent dir (see REPOS_ROOT)
#   - each OS repo already did the one-time:
#       git subtree add --prefix=core <core-remote> main --squash
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/sync-core.sh                # pull core into every repo found
#   ./scripts/sync-core.sh --dry-run      # show what would happen, touch nothing
#   ./scripts/sync-core.sh dotfiles-Fedora dotfiles-Arch   # only these
#
# Env overrides:
#   REPOS_ROOT        parent dir holding the repos   (default: parent of this repo)
#   CORE_REMOTE       remote name/URL for dotfiles-core in each OS repo (default: origin of core)
#   CORE_BRANCH       Core branch to vendor          (default: main)
#   SYNC_JOBS         parallel prefetch jobs; 1 disables the warm-up (default: 4)
#   SYNC_SKIP_AUDIT   set to 1 to skip the pre-fan-out audit gate (escape hatch; see below)
#
# FAN-OUT GATE: this is the single point where Core is vendored into the OS-repo fleet, so a
# defect here amplifies N-way — exactly what audit-core.sh exists to prevent. The repo's
# thesis is "gate BEFORE vendoring", but nothing mechanically enforced that AT the step
# that vendors: it relied on the operator remembering `make audit`. So this script now
# runs the audit itself and REFUSES to fan out a red tree (--dry-run is exempt — it
# touches nothing; SYNC_SKIP_AUDIT=1 is the documented escape hatch for a tree you just
# audited). It also warns when local HEAD differs from the remote tip that actually fans
# out, so you never sync a commit you didn't audit locally.
