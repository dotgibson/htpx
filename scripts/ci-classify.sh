#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/ci-classify.sh — map a set of changed paths to which CI gates must run.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ci.yml's change-detection decides, per push, whether the shell matrix / nvim
# steps / Alpine + bench legs run. That logic used to be inline bash INSIDE the
# workflow YAML: untested, unlinted, and drift-prone — a NEW top-level path not
# added to its glob lists would silently skip a gate, and a skipped gate fans out
# to all 9 OS repos undetected. Pulling it here makes it shellcheck-clean, unit-
# tested (scripts/test-core.sh asserts the mapping), and FAIL-CLOSED.
#
# Reads changed paths on stdin, one per line (or the single token `__ALL__` when the
# diff base couldn't be resolved). Writes two KEY=value lines to stdout:
#     shell=<true|false>
#     nvim=<true|false>
# so the caller can append them straight to $GITHUB_OUTPUT.
#
# Buckets (first match per file wins):
#   • infra      scripts/ .github/ .claude/ core.manifest core.version
#                .pre-commit-config.yaml .shellcheckrc Makefile — cross-cutting, force
#                the FULL run
#   • nvim       nvim/**                         → nvim
#   • shell      zsh/ bin/ maint/ tmux/ sesh/ starship/ mise/ git/ **/*.sh → shell
#   • inert      *.md + repo-meta dotfiles       → no gate
#   • anything else → FAIL CLOSED: force the full run and log it. Getting the inert
#     list wrong only costs a wasted full run (safe); the old code's failure mode was
#     a SKIPPED gate (unsafe) — this inverts that, matching ci.yml's "safe default".
