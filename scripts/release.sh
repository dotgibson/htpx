# scripts/release.sh — cut a Core release in one command (B9).
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Releasing was a manual, drift-prone TWO-file edit (bump core.version, then move
# CHANGELOG's [Unreleased] under a dated heading), caught only REACTIVELY by the audit's
# version/CHANGELOG coherence gate. This does both mechanically, then runs the audit so a
# release is proven green BEFORE it's tagged and fanned out to the 9 OS repos.
#
# It deliberately does NOT commit, tag, or push — those are the operator's call. It edits
# the two files, runs the gate, and prints the exact git commands to finish. Safe to
# inspect with `git diff` and revert if anything looks off.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z          # bump to a clean SemVer release
#   make release VERSION=X.Y.Z
