# Changelog

All notable changes to **htpx** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

htpx is the source of truth for the red↔blue paired corpus; it is vendored into
`dotfiles-Kali` at `offensive/companion/` via `git subtree`. Cutting a release
here (a new top version below) tags the repo and fans the change OUT to
`dotfiles-Kali` as a `companion.lock`-bump PR — see
`.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml` and `.github/workflows/sync-fanout.yml`.

## How releasing works

Add user-visible changes under `[Unreleased]`. To cut a release, move the
`[Unreleased]` entries under a new `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading and push to
`main`: `auto-tag.yml` sees the new top version, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and publishes a
GitHub Release; `sync-fanout.yml` then opens the Kali sync PR.

## [Unreleased]

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Release automation: `auto-tag.yml` tags + releases on a new top CHANGELOG
  version, and `sync-fanout.yml` fans the released ref out to `dotfiles-Kali` as a
  `companion.lock`-bump PR (this CHANGELOG seeds that pipeline at the current tag).

## [v1.1.0]

### Added

- Polished README landing-page hero.

## [v1.0.0]

### Added

- Initial standalone extraction of the structured red↔blue paired companion from
  `dotfiles-Kali`: `htpx` fzf browser, `gen-views.sh` source-of-truth bridge with
  `--check` drift gate, and the ATT&CK-tagged `entries/red|blue/*.md` corpus.
