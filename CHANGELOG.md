# Changelog

All notable changes to **htpx** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

htpx is the source of truth for the red↔blue paired corpus; it is vendored into
`dotfiles-Kali` at `offensive/companion/` via `git subtree`. Cutting a release
here (a new top version below) tags the repo and fans the change OUT to
`dotfiles-Kali` as a `companion.lock`-bump PR — see
`.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml` and `.github/workflows/sync-fanout.yml`.

## How releasing works

Add user-visible changes under `[Unreleased]`. To cut a release, move the
`[Unreleased]` entries under a new `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading and push to
`main`: `auto-tag.yml` sees the new top version, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and publishes a
GitHub Release; `sync-fanout.yml` then opens the Kali sync PR.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Jenkins CI/CD** platform (3 companion-only red↔blue pairs) — the self-hosted
  counterpart to the GitHub/GitLab SaaS rounds, detected via the Jenkins Audit Trail
  plugin log (`product: jenkins`, keyword/URI matches):
  - `jenkins-script-console` ↔ `jenkins-script-console-audit` — Groovy Script Console
    RCE + in-memory credential dump; detect `/script` / `/scriptText` (T1059).
  - `jenkins-api-token` ↔ `jenkins-api-token-audit` — mint a user API token for durable
    non-interactive access; detect `generateNewToken` (T1098).
  - `jenkins-job-backdoor` ↔ `jenkins-job-backdoor-audit` — create/reconfigure a job to
    run attacker code on the controller + agents; detect `/createItem` / `/configSubmit`
    (T1072).

- **Terraform Cloud / IaC** platform (3 companion-only red↔blue pairs) — detections
  are Terraform Cloud audit-trail SPL (`product: terraform`, nested `resource.type` /
  `resource.action`):
  - `tfc-agent-hijack` ↔ `tfc-agent-audit` — rogue agent pool routes plans/applies to
    attacker infra (captures cloud creds + state); detect `agent_pool` `create` (T1543).
  - `tfc-token-backdoor` ↔ `tfc-token-audit` — mint an org/team API token for durable
    API + state access; detect `authentication_token` `create` (T1098).
  - `tfc-var-injection` ↔ `tfc-var-audit` — inject a workspace env variable to run code
    / exfil at apply; detect `variable` `create`/`update` (T1072).

- **HashiCorp Vault** platform (3 companion-only red↔blue pairs), opening the
  secrets-management seam — detections are Vault audit-device SPL (`product: vault`
  on the Sigma side):
  - `vault-secret-exfil` ↔ `vault-secret-read-audit` — bulk-read KV secrets to drain
    the credential store; detect `read` breadth over `secret/` paths (T1555).
  - `vault-approle-backdoor` ↔ `vault-approle-audit` — create a rogue AppRole for
    durable machine auth; detect create/update on `auth/approle/role/` (T1098).
  - `vault-audit-disable` ↔ `vault-audit-device-audit` — disable a Vault audit device
    to blind the SIEM; detect `delete` on a `sys/audit/` path (T1562.001).

- **GitLab CI/CD** platform (3 companion-only red↔blue pairs), mirroring the GitHub
  Actions round on GitLab audit-event telemetry (`product: gitlab`, field
  `event_type`):
  - `gl-runner-hijack` ↔ `gl-runner-audit` — attach an attacker-controlled runner to
    the project to capture CI jobs + masked variables; detect
    `set_runner_associated_projects` (T1543).
  - `gl-protected-branch-off` ↔ `gl-protected-branch-audit` — remove protected-branch
    rules to land unreviewed code; detect `protected_branch_removed` /
    `protected_branch_created` (T1562.001).
  - `gl-token-backdoor` ↔ `gl-token-audit` — mint a project access / deploy token for
    durable access; detect `project_access_token_created` /
    `personal_access_token_created` / `deploy_token_created` (T1098).
- **Harbor container registry** platform (3 companion-only red↔blue pairs), opening
  the container-image / registry supply-chain seam — detections are Harbor
  registry audit-log SPL (`product: harbor` on the Sigma side):
  - `harbor-image-backdoor` ↔ `harbor-image-push-audit` — push a trojanized image
    over a trusted tag to poison downstream pulls; detect `operation=push`
    artifact (T1525, Implant Internal Image).
  - `harbor-robot-backdoor` ↔ `harbor-robot-audit` — mint a long-lived robot
    account for durable registry access; detect `operation=create`
    `resource_type=robot` (T1098).
  - `harbor-artifact-delete` ↔ `harbor-artifact-delete-audit` — delete the trusted
    artifact to force a poisoned re-pull + erase evidence; detect `operation=delete`
    artifact/repository (T1070).
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** platform (3 companion-only red↔blue pairs), opening a
  new logsource the way the Okta round did — detections are GitHub Enterprise
  audit-log SPL (`product: github` on the Sigma side):
  - `gh-self-hosted-runner` ↔ `gh-runner-audit` — rogue self-hosted runner
    harvests job source + secrets; detect `self_hosted_runner.created` (T1543).
  - `gh-branch-protection-off` ↔ `gh-branch-protection-audit` — disable/override
    branch protection to land unreviewed code; detect `protected_branch.destroy` /
    `protected_branch.policy_override` (T1562.001).
  - `gh-deploy-key-backdoor` ↔ `gh-cred-audit` — writable deploy key / fine-grained
    PAT for durable access; detect `repo.create_deploy_key` /
    `personal_access_token.access_granted` (T1098).
- Corpus is now 53 paired concepts + 1 unpaired recon entry.

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- `sync-fanout.yml` Sync step: call Kali's `sync-companion.sh` with NO argument.
  It was passed `main` as a positional, but that arg is the REMOTE (URL), not a
  branch so it tried to pull from a remote named `main` (`fatal: 'main' does
not appear to be a git repository`). The script derives both the htpx remote
  and the branch (`main`) from `companion.lock` itself.
- `sync-fanout.yml` auth: the Sync step now injects all git auth + the bot identity
  via step-scoped `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`/`KEY`/`VALUE` instead of `git config --global`
  (no token written to `~/.gitconfig`; consistent with the Resolve step).
  htpx is read with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` via a more-specific,
  `.git`-anchored `url.insteadOf` (longest match wins, and the anchor avoids
  rewriting same-prefix repos like `<owner>/htpx-tools`), so the
  `git subtree pull` works without `FLEET_SYNC_TOKEN` ever needing htpx access;
  `FLEET_SYNC_TOKEN` stays scoped to the dotfiles-Kali clone/push/PR.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- `sync-fanout.yml` Resolve step: the htpx clone / `ls-remote` reads are now
  authenticated with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`contents: read`). They were
  unauthenticated, so on a private htpx the fan-out died at the first clone with
  `could not read Username for 'https://github.com'`. Auth is injected via
  `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`/`KEY`/`VALUE` env (an `url.insteadOf` rewrite scoped to that
  step), so the token is never written to `~/.gitconfig` and can't shadow the next
  step's `actions/checkout`; `FLEET_SYNC_TOKEN` stays reserved for the cross-repo
  writes to dotfiles-Kali.
- Release + fan-out workflows hardened (PR review): `auto-tag.sh` now fails loud
  when `--release` is requested but `gh` is absent; `auto-tag.yml` cuts
  tags/releases only from the default branch; `sync-fanout.yml` resolves and
  verifies the tag exists before checkout (a bad dispatch input is a clean no-op),
  aborts the sync if `gen-views.sh` fails (no PR), and fails on ANY `core.lock`
  diff versus the base branch — not just the `core_sha` field.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Release automation: `auto-tag.yml` tags + releases on a new top CHANGELOG
  version, and `sync-fanout.yml` fans the released ref out to `dotfiles-Kali`
  as a `companion.lock`-bump PR this CHANGELOG seeds that pipeline at the
  current tag.

## [v1.1.0]

### Added

- Polished README landing-page hero.

## [v1.0.0]

### Added

- Initial standalone extraction of the structured red↔blue paired companion from
  `dotfiles-Kali`: `htpx` fzf browser, `gen-views.sh` source-of-truth bridge with
  `--check` drift gate, and the ATT&CK-tagged `entries/red|blue/*.md` corpus.
