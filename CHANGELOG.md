# Changelog

All notable changes to **dotfiles-core** are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Core is the single source of truth vendored into seven OS repos via
`git subtree pull --prefix=core <core-remote> main --squash` (see `scripts/sync-core.sh`).
Every entry below is therefore a change those repos receive on their next sync —
this file is the human-readable record of _what_ a sync will bring, complementing
the SHA that `scripts/sync-core.sh` now prints. To cut a release, move the
`[Unreleased]` items under a new `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading and tag the
commit (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m vX.Y.Z`).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`bootstrap-lib.sh` gains opt-in dry-run + tallies** (`lib/bootstrap-lib.sh`) — the
  shared provisioning scaffold now honors `BLIB_DRY=1`: `blib_link` / `blib_seed` /
  `blib_link_core` / `blib_write_zshrc_loader` / `blib_set_login_shell` PRINT what they
  would do and change nothing — every mutation (symlink, backup, seed copy, chmod, the tpm
  clone, the ssh perms, the `.zshrc` write, the `chsh`) is guarded — so an OS bootstrap's
  `--dry-run` can preview the whole plan instead of each repo hand-rolling it. `blib_link`
  also gained an idempotent already-correct-link no-op and a missing-source skip; the two
  inline git/sesh seed blocks are unified into a new `blib_seed`; `BLIB_*` counters +
  `blib_wire_summary` give a "N linked · M seeded · K backed up" footer. **Backward
  compatible** — `BLIB_DRY` defaults off and the non-dry path is byte-for-byte the prior
  behaviour, so the already-adopted Fedora/Arch/Alpine/openSUSE/Gentoo/Kali bootstraps are
  unaffected. This unblocks MacBook adopting the shared scaffold without losing its
  `--dry-run`. Verified: dry run creates zero files; a real run wires all 25 links + 2
  seeds; a re-run backs up nothing.
- **De-forked `update.zsh`'s per-shell path** (`zsh/update.zsh`) — the throttle check
  and the upgrade nudge ran `date +%s` once and `sed -n Np` twice on **every**
  interactive shell, three subprocess spawns (~1.7 ms each, measured) on the critical
  path before the first prompt — the exact fork tax this stack's cached inits + deferred
  plugins exist to avoid. Replaced with zsh builtins: `$EPOCHSECONDS` (a `zsh/datetime`
  param) for the clock and `$(<file)` + `${(f)…}` for the two-line cache read, removing
  all three forks (~5 ms off a warm shell) with byte-identical behaviour and a `date`
  fallback if the module is unavailable. Profiled with `make profile`; the `_pkgup_*`
  parse + nudge unit tests are unchanged and green. (A profile-led pivot: caching
  `tools.zsh`'s `command -v` probes — only ~1.8 ms total, and a stale cache could hide a
  newly-installed tool — was measured and rejected as not worth the footgun.)
- **Dropped `dotfiles-Debian` from the documented fleet.** The Debian OS-native
  repo was only ever planned, never created, and is no longer being pursued — so
  the fleet docs that named it as a real target were ahead of reality. Removed it
  from the OS-native repo lists (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, `PORTING-MATRIX.md`), reframed it in `scripts/os-repos.txt` from
  "planned" to a documented permanent absence (so it is not re-added), and dropped
  it from the `claude-routines` fleet-clone loop. This also reconciles the
  "nine-repo system" / "seven vendoring OS repos" counts, which the phantom Debian
  entry had thrown off by one. Debian _distro-family_ facts (the `bat`→`batcat` /
  `fd`→`fdfind` renames, Kali being Debian-family) are unaffected and retained.

### Added

- **`gsync` upstream-sync shortcut** (`.bin/sync-upstream.sh`, `zsh/aliases.zsh`) —
  a one-word alias that `git subtree push`es an OS repo's vendored `core/` subtree
  back upstream to dotfiles-core (`main`) — the prefix that matches the registered
  `core/` ⇄ root@main subtree boundary. The runner refuses to run unless a `core/`
  subtree is present (so it no-ops in dotfiles-core, the source of truth) and bails
  on a dirty working tree. The alias resolves the script relative to the sourced
  module via the `${(%):-%x}` trick (the same one `maint.zsh` uses), so the
  shortcut survives the `core/` subtree vendoring without putting `.bin` on `PATH`.
  Registered in `core.manifest`.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** — a strategic architecture overview: the three-layer
  model and its boundary test, the full fleet map (which repos vendor `core/`
  and which don't), the one-directional subtree vendoring topology, the
  load-bearing zsh load order, the audit gate, and the rationale for the model.
  Sits above `README.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md` (which stay operational) and
  cross-references them. Added to the audit's repo-meta allowlist; it is docs,
  not shipped Core.
- **`parity-check` gate** (`scripts/parity-check.sh`, `make parity-check`, weekly
  `.github/workflows/parity-check.yml`) — mechanises the `aligned` rows of `PARITY.md`:
  asserts a distinctive needle (starship/zoxide/atuin init, the fzf tokyonight palette,
  the `fd` default command) is present in **both** a zsh source and the pwsh source,
  failing when one side drifts. Reads pwsh from a sibling `dotfiles-Windows` checkout
  (skipped with a notice if absent, unless `--strict`; the workflow clones it and runs
  `--strict`), the same cross-repo pattern as `fleet-drift.sh`. The fzf-palette row is
  the regression guard for the parity fix just shipped; keybinding rows join the checker
  as each open decision is made. `make audit` green.
- **`PARITY.md` — the cross-shell parity contract** — the source of truth for what
  "the same on zsh and PowerShell" means, mapping every prompt/alias/keybinding/
  function capability to `aligned` (must stay in step), `deliberate` (intentional
  platform difference), or `gap` (open item). Makes the WSL-zsh ↔ Windows-pwsh
  divergences a documented decision instead of silent drift, and names the open
  decisions (the `Ctrl+G` sesh-vs-navi collision, the file-picker key, the atuin
  key, the `gaf`/`grf`/`grsf` + `Alt+Z` ports). Paired with a same-change fix that
  brings the **fzf tokyonight-storm palette to pwsh** (`dotfiles-Windows`
  `powershell/core/10-tools.ps1`), which previously fell back to terminal-default
  colours — the first `aligned` row closed. A future `scripts/parity-check.sh` can
  mechanise the `aligned` rows the way `fleet-drift.sh` mechanised provenance.
- **`core/` edit guard** (`blib_install_core_guard` in `lib/bootstrap-lib.sh`, wired into
  `scripts/sync-core.sh`) — a local `pre-commit` hook that refuses commits touching the
  vendored `core/` subtree, turning the prose rule "never hand-edit `core/`" into a
  mechanical block. Motivated by a real incident: an upstream "Lazy lock update" edited a
  vendored `core/nvim/lazy-lock.json` directly, drifting it from canonical Core. `sync-core.sh`
  now (re)installs the hook into every repo it fans out to (so the protection lands on the
  maintainer's machine, where the edit happens) and exempts its own legitimate subtree
  writes via `DOTFILES_ALLOW_CORE_EDIT=1`; a one-off bypass is the standard
  `git commit --no-verify`. Idempotent and non-destructive — it never clobbers a
  pre-existing unrelated `pre-commit` hook. Covered by hermetic git tests in
  `scripts/test-core.sh`. (Wiring it into each OS `bootstrap.sh` for fresh clones rides
  along with the pending `bootstrap-lib.sh` adoption.)
- **Fleet-drift check** (`scripts/fleet-drift.sh`, `make fleet-drift`, and a weekly
  `.github/workflows/fleet-drift.yml`) — reads every OS repo's `core.lock`
  (`core_sha=…`) plus `dotfiles-Windows`'s `nvim/.core-ref` (`commit = …`) and reports
  which repos lag Core's tip (BEHIND/AHEAD/DIVERGED, quantified in commits). Closes the
  gap where the per-repo provenance markers existed but nothing compared them, so a repo
  could silently sit on a stale Core (how the nvim lockfile drifted). Read-only — the
  fix is a human running `make sync`; a not-checked-out repo is skipped unless `--strict`.
  The reference commit is `--ref`/`$CORE_REF_SHA` → `origin/main` → `main` → `HEAD`.
  Fleet list is the same `scripts/os-repos.txt` `sync-core.sh` reads; the scheduled
  workflow anonymously shallow-clones the public repos and fails red on drift.
- **`.github/workflows/bootstrap-test.yml`** — a _reusable_ (`workflow_call`)
  bootstrap integration test, authored once here and called by a thin ~10-line
  stub in each OS repo, so the OS repos gain CI without each carrying a duplicated
  copy of the logic (the same fan-out the Core layer exists to kill). Two jobs:
  `lint` runs `shellcheck -x` + `bash -n` + `--help` on `bootstrap.sh` (the OS
  repos previously had no CI at all, so this is their first gate); `links-only`
  runs `bootstrap.sh --links-only` inside the target distro's container and
  asserts the symlink graph + the generated `~/.zshrc` (it pre-seeds the tpm dir
  to skip the network clone, mirroring `test-core.sh`'s offline technique, and
  leaves the actual module load — already covered hermetically by `test-core.sh` —
  alone). Callers pass `image`/`prep`/`offensive`; Kali sets `offensive: true`.
- **`lib/bootstrap-lib.sh`** — a vendored BASH provisioning scaffold that ends the
  per-repo bootstrap fan-out. Roughly half of each OS bootstrap.sh was the _same_
  code — `link()`, `read_pkgs()`, WSL detection, the Core-symlink loop, the `.zshrc`
  loader heredoc, the default-login-shell logic — copy-pasted and then independently
  reformatted, so a fix had to be made in every repo by hand (the exact N-way drift
  Core exists to kill, leaking through the one file that can't be vendored). The
  shared half now lives here as `blib_*` helpers (`blib_link`, `blib_read_pkgs`,
  `blib_is_wsl`, `blib_link_core`, `blib_link_os_layer`, `blib_write_zshrc_loader`,
  `blib_set_login_shell`), sourced by each bootstrap.sh alongside `lib/ux.sh`. The
  loader writer takes the module list as an argument, so a role repo (Kali) injects
  its `offensive` stage; the login-shell helper takes `$BLIB_SU` so a doas-only or
  root box works. The `core/`-presence check stays inline per bootstrap (you cannot
  source a lib out of `core/` before confirming `core/` exists). Listed in
  `core.manifest`; sourced (non-exec) like `lib/ux.sh`. Adopting it in each OS
  bootstrap.sh is a follow-up that lands after this is synced out.
- **`pullall [dir]` shell function** (`zsh/functions.zsh`) — fast-update every git
  repo under a parent directory in parallel: prunes deleted remote branches,
  stashes uncommitted tracked changes, switches to each repo's auto-detected trunk
  (main/master/trunk/… via `origin/HEAD`, not a hard-coded `main`), fast-forwards
  it, pops the stash back (reporting a pop conflict instead of swallowing it), then
  prints a summary card. The parent directory is configurable (argument →
  `$PULLALL_DIR` → CWD) so Core stays machine-agnostic; parallelism via
  `xargs -P` (`$PULLALL_JOBS`, default 10). Colour is TTY/`NO_COLOR`-aware and
  repo paths are passed positionally (no shell injection from odd names). Ships
  with a `_pullall` completion, a `core-help` row, and behavioural tests.
- **`dotfiles-Defense-PLAN.md`** — a forward-looking architecture note plus a
  complete, ready-to-instantiate skeleton for a future `dotfiles-Defense` repo
  (the defensive/blue Role layer that mirrors `dotfiles-Kali`). Records the
  red/blue split decision, the trigger for standing the repo up, the layer-table
  identity, and every scaffold file verbatim (README, CLAUDE.md, bootstrap,
  `defense.zsh`, methodology, gitignore, compose stub, templates) so the repo can
  be `git init`-ed when the trigger is met. Added to the audit's repo-meta
  allowlist; it is planning, not shipped Core.
- **Claude Code project memory + maintenance routines** (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`) —
  a root `CLAUDE.md` encoding the three-layer model, the "is it Core?" test, the
  manifest contract, and the load order so every Claude session reasons from the
  real rules. Three on-demand slash commands automate the judgment-heavy chores the
  audit can't: `/doc-audit` (prose-vs-reality drift across the fleet, via the
  `doc-consistency` subagent), `/tool-scout` (research the modern-CLI stack for
  tools worth adopting, via the `tool-scout` subagent), and `/freshness-triage`
  (review dependency-bump PRs against upstream changelogs). All report-first; none
  vendor out without a green `make audit`. `CLAUDE.md` added to the audit's
  repo-meta allowlist (`.claude/` was already a prefix).
- **Scheduled maintenance bots** (`.github/workflows/claude-routines.yml`) — run the
  `/doc-audit` and `/tool-scout` routines headless on a weekly cron (and on demand),
  filing findings as a deduplicated GitHub issue. The Claude Code CLI is installed
  from npm (pinned via `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` in `scripts/tool-versions.env`) — no
  third-party action, mirroring `freshness.yml`. Auth is a Claude subscription token
  (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, from `claude setup-token`); inert until that secret is
  set (the workflow no-ops with a warning otherwise).
- **`make release-notes` + `cliff.toml`** — git-cliff config + a Makefile target that
  drafts a GitHub Release body from Conventional Commits since the last release commit.
  Scoped dev-tooling (audit allowlist, not `core.manifest`, zero runtime cost); it does
  **not** generate `CHANGELOG.md` (that stays hand-curated and is promoted by
  `scripts/release.sh`). Surfaced by `/tool-scout` (issue #44).
- **`aliases.md`** is now surfaced in the changelog — the cross-fleet aliases cheat
  sheet (Core + per-OS + offensive layers), previously shipped without an entry.

### Fixed

- **`gsync` runner + core-guard installer hardening** (review follow-up to the
  fan-out PRs). `.bin/sync-upstream.sh`: normalize to the git toplevel first so
  `gsync` works from any subdirectory (it is an absolute-path runner); use
  `git status --porcelain` for the clean-tree check so untracked files also block
  (`git diff-index HEAD` missed them); and reword the failure hint to be
  auth-agnostic (the remote is HTTPS, not SSH) and point at the right re-pull
  command for an OS repo. `zsh/aliases.zsh`: `gsync` is now a wrapper function,
  not an alias, so a dotfiles path containing whitespace stays one word and args
  pass through — with a matching `_gsync` completion and `core-help` row.
  `lib/bootstrap-lib.sh` `blib_install_core_guard`: detect the git work tree and
  hooks dir via `git rev-parse` (so worktrees/submodules, where `.git` is a file,
  get the guard too), skip with a warning when `core.hooksPath` is set (installing
  into the ignored `.git/hooks` was false protection), and return non-zero instead
  of silently succeeding if the hooks dir can't be created. New hermetic test
  covers the `core.hooksPath` skip.
- **`sync-core.sh` pre-fan-out audit no longer false-fails on the core-guard test.**
  The script `export`s `DOTFILES_ALLOW_CORE_EDIT=1` for its own legitimate subtree
  commits, but that exemption was still in the environment when it ran the
  pre-fan-out `audit-core.sh` — whose behavioral suite commits to a throwaway
  `core/` and asserts the guard hook BLOCKS it. The inherited exemption made that
  assertion fail, reding an otherwise-green tree and forcing `SYNC_SKIP_AUDIT=1`.
  The audit now runs via `env -u DOTFILES_ALLOW_CORE_EDIT` (it never writes to
  `core/`, so it needs no exemption); the fan-out commits keep theirs.
- **`bootstrap-lib.sh` now wires three Core files it silently dropped.**
  `blib_link_core` linked starship/nvim/mise/git/tmux/clip but omitted
  `core/lazygit/config.yml` (→ `~/.config/lazygit/config.yml`), `core/vim/vimrc`
  (→ `~/.vimrc`), and the `core/sesh/sesh.toml.example` seed
  (→ `~/.config/sesh/sesh.toml`) — three files that are in `core.manifest` (the
  manifest comments even spell out their destinations) yet reached no machine,
  inherited from the per-repo bootstraps this library consolidated. lazygit + vim
  symlink like starship; sesh is seeded (copied, never relinked) like the git
  identity file. The matching `bootstrap-test.yml` assertions for these three were
  briefly **deferred** — that reusable test is referenced `@main` by every adopter, so
  it can only assert what each adopter's CURRENT vendored `core/` produces, and asserting
  the wiring before `make sync` propagated it would have red-flagged Fedora/Kali. They are
  **now re-added**: every adopter's `core.lock` is at a Core that includes the wiring, so
  the `@main` test asserts lazygit/`~/.vimrc`/seeded-sesh again without false reds.
- **`freshness.yml` opens its pin-bump PRs against the default branch**, not the
  dispatched ref (`GITHUB_REF_NAME`), and uses a ref-independent concurrency group —
  so a manual run from a feature branch can't target the wrong base or race the cron.
- **`aliases.md`** — corrected the `myip` expansion (it redirects stderr:
  `curl -fsS https://ifconfig.me 2>/dev/null && echo`) and repo-qualified the
  cross-repo source paths in the header so they don't read as broken local links.
- **`doc-consistency` subagent** — aligned its system description with the canonical
  nine-repo, three-layer (Core → OS-native → Role) wording.
- **`audit-core.sh`** — clarified the META-allowlist comments: those files are "not
  shipped Core" (absent from `core.manifest`), not "never vendored" (the subtree copy
  carries them physically).
- **Doc drift caught by `/doc-audit`** — corrected "vendored into/fans out to _nine_
  OS repos" → _eight_ (Windows vendors no `core/`) in `CHANGELOG.md` + `CONTRIBUTING.md`;
  added the manifest-listed `zsh/loader.zsh` and `lazygit/config.yml` to the README
  Layout tree; completed the README tmux-scripts list (added `tmux-battery`/`tmux-cheat`);
  and attributed the `cheat` alias to `functions.zsh` (not `aliases.zsh`) in `aliases.md`.

### Security

- **CI tool downloads are now SHA-256 verified.** The `setup-core-tools` composite
  action previously fetched its pinned gate binaries (shellcheck, actionlint, gitleaks,
  neovim) with `curl … | tar` and **no integrity check** — a tampered or MITM'd release
  asset would have executed inside the gate. Each install now downloads to a file,
  verifies it against a pinned hash from `scripts/tool-versions.env`, and only then
  installs; a mismatch fails the build. `shfmt` was folded into the action (it was the
  last tool still installed via inline `curl` in the OS-repo lint workflows), so one
  verified definition now covers every downloaded gate tool.
- **`scripts/tool-versions.env`** gained a `*_SHA256` per downloaded tool (the single
  source the action reads alongside each `*_VERSION`), plus `SHFMT_VERSION`.
- **`scripts/audit-core.sh`** gained a "tool download integrity" section that fails the
  audit if any pinned `*_VERSION` lacks a 64-hex `*_SHA256` — a version can no longer be
  bumped without refreshing its checksum.
- **`scripts/update-tool-checksums.sh`** (new) recomputes the pinned hashes from the
  exact assets the action downloads, so a version bump is a one-command checksum refresh.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **fzf-assisted git staging** (`zsh/git.zsh`) — `gaf` / `grf` / `grsf`, fuzzy
  multi-select counterparts to `git add` / `restore` / `restore --staged`. Each
  guards on `fzf` like the `fzf.zsh` zle widgets, depends only on git + fzf (both
  in the Core stack), and NUL-pipes paths so filenames with spaces survive `xargs`.
- **`vim/vimrc`** — a plugin-free, self-contained vim fallback for boxes where only
  stock vim exists (minimal containers, rescue shells, freshly-SSH'd servers). netrw
  as the file browser, no network, keybindings echoing the Neovim config. The OS
  bootstrap symlinks it to `~/.vimrc`.

### Changed

- **Adaptive eslint linting** (`nvim/lua/gerrrt/plugins/nvim-lint.lua`) — the eslint
  family (js/ts/jsx/tsx/svelte/vue) now lints only when an eslint config is found
  upward from the buffer, mirroring the existing SC1071/ruff guards. Prevents
  `eslint_d`'s hard error from surfacing as a phantom diagnostic in projects with no
  eslint config. Non-eslint linters still run unconditionally.

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-06-19

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **lazygit theme** (`lazygit/config.yml`) — a tokyonight-storm theme matching
  `starship.toml`, the tmux bar, and `zsh/fzf.zsh`, so lazygit (reached via the `lg`
  alias and the `prefix + g` tmux popup) reads as one palette with the rest of the
  stack. Bootstrap symlinks it to `~/.config/lazygit/config.yml`.
- **`genpw [length]`** — portable random-password generator (`zsh/functions.zsh`):
  prefers `openssl`, falls back to `/dev/urandom` so it works on a bare rescue shell.
  Ships with its completion (`zsh/completions/_genpw`) and a `core-help` entry.
- **fzf tokyonight palette** — `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` (`zsh/fzf.zsh`) now sets an explicit
  tokyonight-storm `--color` set instead of inheriting the terminal palette, keeping
  fzf on-theme even over SSH into an unthemed box.
- Audit **`--strict`** now fails only on gates skipped because their TOOL is absent (an
  out-of-scope skip stays intentional), so CI runs it on the Linux leg — closing the last
  "green because a linter silently failed to install" gap. CI also installs `python3-yaml`
  so the YAML-parse gate is honest under `--strict`.
- **Core⇄OS boundary** audit gate: portable `zsh/*.zsh` modules may carry no OS-absolute
  paths (`/opt/homebrew`, `~/Library`, …), mechanically enforcing the README's "if it
  changes with the OS it isn't Core" rule. `zsh/maint.zsh` (the OS-switched scheduler
  surface) is the documented exception.
- **`core.version` ↔ `CHANGELOG`** coherence gate: a prerelease stamp must keep an
  `[Unreleased]` section open; a release stamp must have a matching `## [vX.Y.Z]` heading.
- Behavioral coverage for `git.zsh` (`git_main_branch`/`git_current_branch` trunk +
  detached-HEAD resolution) and for `_pkgup_count`/`_pkgup_list` parsing on
  apk/dnf/zypper/pacman — previously only apt was exercised.
- `core-help` now lists the most-used **git aliases** (the OMZ-style set in `git.zsh`),
  so they are discoverable from the cheat sheet.
- `core.version` — a human-readable SemVer stamp vendored into every OS repo, plus a
  `core-version` verb that reads it, so you can tell WHICH Core a given OS repo carries
  from inside it (the subtree squash records the commit; this records the version).
  `scripts/sync-core.sh` prints it on fan-out and the audit asserts it is well-formed.
- `core-doctor` — the shell counterpart to nvim's `:checkhealth gerrrt`: a scannable
  report of which modern-CLI tools Core detected on this box and which integrations are
  live, including the RESOLVED binary names (`fd`/`fdfind`, `bat`/`batcat`) and the
  detected package manager. Read-only.
- `up -n`/`--dry-run` — list the packages that WOULD upgrade and exit, touching nothing
  (the non-destructive inspect the count-only nudge didn't offer).
- `make audit-changed` (`audit-core.sh --changed`) — scope the audit to what your local
  git diff touches, via the SAME `scripts/ci-classify.sh` CI uses; fails safe to the
  full run when the diff can't be resolved.
- First-party completions for `fif`, `fbr`, `core-version`, and `core-doctor`, and a
  `core.version`/`up --dry-run`-aware `_up`; the completion-parity test now covers them.
- `.shellcheckrc` — repo-wide ShellCheck config (`external-sources`, `source-path`,
  `shell=bash`) so author-time, CI, and editor lint identically.
- `zsh/ui.zsh` — shared terminal-UX primitives (`_core_err`/`_core_warn`/`_core_ok`/
  `_core_hint`/`_core_usage`/`_core_confirm`/`_core_spin`), gum-aware with a plain
  fallback on every helper. Loads right after `tools` in the canonical chain and is
  adopted across `functions.zsh`, `op.zsh`, `update.zsh`, and `plugins.zsh`, replacing
  ad-hoc `echo "Usage: …"` lines with one consistent voice (colour only on a TTY,
  `NO_COLOR` honoured, diagnostics to stderr).
- `core-help` (alias `cheat`): a grouped, column-aligned cheat sheet of Core's
  functions, keybindings, and maintenance verbs — the shell counterpart to which-key.
  Plus a once-per-machine first-run hint pointing at it (`CORE_WELCOME=0` to silence).
- First-party zsh completions (`zsh/completions/`) for Core's own verbs — `up`,
  `extract` (archive files only), `mkcd`, `mkbak`, `maint-log`, `openv` — fpath-added
  by `options.zsh` (symlink-safe; no bootstrap symlink needed). The audit now `zsh -n`s
  them alongside `zsh/*.zsh`.
- `scripts/lib/common.sh` — one definition of the colour palette + `pass`/`skip`/`fail`/
  `hdr`/`have` shared by all five gate scripts (the block had been copy-pasted ×5). A
  sourced lib, so — like `zsh/*.zsh` — it stays mode 100644; the audit's exec-bit
  section gained a `scripts/lib/*.sh` arm to assert exactly that.
- `scripts/tool-versions.env` — single source for the pinned dev-tool versions, read by
  CI (loaded into `$GITHUB_ENV`), `make setup`, and the audit. `scripts/setup.sh` +
  `make setup`: a one-command dev bootstrap (pre-commit hooks + version doctor + audit).
- `actionlint` gate on the workflows: an audit section (graceful skip when absent) plus
  a pinned CI install — the workflow YAML is now validated, not just parsed.
- Audit version-consistency section: the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` hook revs are gated
  to equal `scripts/tool-versions.env`, so a one-sided pin bump fails the audit.
- Hermetic behavioral tests for `bin/clip` / `bin/clip-paste` (the highest-fan-out
  runtime artifact — used by zsh, tmux, and nvim): a new section in
  `scripts/test-core.sh` drives the WSL→macOS→Wayland→X11 detection ladder against a
  fake `PATH`, asserting the right backend is chosen. Runs even where zsh is absent.
- Headless Neovim config-load smoke test in `scripts/test-core.sh`: loads the authored
  config layer and every plugin spec offline (no install), catching luacheck-clean Lua
  that is nonetheless a broken config. CI ships a pinned `nvim` (`NVIM_VERSION`) so it
  runs on both userlands instead of skipping.
- Alpine (musl/busybox) CI leg, run via a bind-mounted container, finally exercising
  the busybox-coreutils compatibility the scripts have always claimed.
- `scripts/update-plugins.sh` + `make update-plugins`: deliberately roll the pinned
  zsh-plugin SHAs to upstream HEAD — the runtime-plugin mirror of `make update-hooks`.
- Markdown lint gate: `.markdownlint.jsonc` rule config, a `markdownlint` section in
  `scripts/audit-core.sh` (graceful skip when absent), a `markdownlint-cli2` pre-commit
  hook, and a pinned CI install step — so the docs (the deliverable on a public
  showcase repo) are gated like everything else.
- `scripts/bench-core.sh` gained an optional `CORE_BENCH_BUDGET_MS` budget gate (fails
  when the canonical-chain startup mean exceeds the budget), plus a non-blocking CI
  `bench` job that reports the number on every push.
- `SECURITY.md` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug + feature + config) round out the
  GitHub community profile; `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents a Conventional Commits
  convention.
- Broader behavioral coverage in `scripts/test-core.sh`: `mkbak` byte-identity,
  `extract` unknown-format rejection, and `extract` round-trips for `.tar.gz`/`.gz`
  (the latter skip gracefully when `tar`/`gzip` are absent).
- CI runs the audit on a `[ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]` matrix, gating the macOS
  (bash 3.2 / BSD userland) target — `dotfiles-MacBook` — alongside Linux.
- `scripts/audit-core.sh` and the pre-commit config parse-check every tracked TOML and
  YAML file, catching malformed `starship.toml` / `mise/config.toml` / workflow
  YAML that is valid text but dead at runtime for every consumer.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `scripts/sync-core.sh` reports the exact dotfiles-core revision (short SHA) each OS
  repo receives, so a sync is traceable.
- `scripts/bench-core.sh` + `make bench`: a hermetic hyperfine benchmark of the
  canonical Core load chain, so startup-perf regressions (the thing tools.zsh's
  caching and plugins.zsh's deferral exist to prevent) are measurable, not silent.
- A `command_not_found_handler` (zsh): a mistyped command now gets a Core-voice miss
  that suggests the nearest Core verb on a near typo (`extarct` → `extract`, via a
  small built-in Levenshtein) or, failing that, an install line for this box's detected
  package manager — instead of zsh's terse default. Interactive-only; `CORE_CNF_ENABLED=0`
  opts out.
- `make doctor` (`scripts/setup.sh --doctor`): the read-only half of `make setup` —
  reports each dev tool against its pin with no install and no audit, for quick "is my
  toolchain aligned with CI?" triage.
- `core-help <word>` filters the cheat sheet to matching rows (and reports a no-match
  cleanly), so jumping to one verb beats scanning the whole sheet.
- `serve` renders the reachable URL as a terminal QR code when `qrencode` is present
  (scan-to-open from a phone) — graceful skip when it isn't.
- `scripts/audit-core.sh --strict`: treat any SKIP as a failure (a gate whose tool was
  absent did not actually run), for release/CI verification where every gate must execute.
- `ui.zsh` primitives: `_core_errbox` (multi-line what/why/fix error blocks),
  `_core_suggest`/`_core_lev` (did-you-mean), reused across the runtime helpers.

### Changed

- The `command_not_found_handler` now also weighs this shell's **aliases** when proposing
  a "did you mean?", so a near miss like `gts`→`gst` is caught, not just the Core verbs.
- The markdown gate resolves `markdownlint-cli2` via PATH → `npx --no-install` →
  `node_modules`, so an off-PATH global install runs instead of skipping (the most-skipped
  gate in remote sessions).
- `_cache_eval` gained `--salt`; the `atuin`/`carapace` inits fold `ATUIN_NOBIND`/
  `CARAPACE_BRIDGES` into the cache filename, so flipping that env busts the cache
  instead of serving a stale init.
- Higher-friction failures now use the structured `_core_errbox` (headline + why/fix):
  `up` with no package manager, and `serve` without `python3`.
- `scripts/setup.sh` provisions `luacheck` via `luarocks` (no clean mise source) and
  emits precise, actionable install hints — closing the last manual onboarding gap.
- Defensive confirms on impactful interactive actions: `please` now previews the exact
  `sudo …` line and confirms before eval'ing it as root (and refuses with no previous
  command); `up` pre-confirms `Apply updates with <mgr>?` before touching the system
  (skipped by `-y`); `serve` warns plainly that it binds `0.0.0.0` and exposes the CWD.
- First-run plugin install shows a spinner on the network-bound `git fetch`/`clone`
  (gum spin when present, a hand-rolled braille spinner otherwise), guarded so an OS
  loader that hasn't adopted `ui.zsh` yet still installs plainly.
- CI is now incremental: a `changes` job classifies the diff and gates the narrow,
  expensive legs — `nvim`+`luacheck` installs run only when `nvim/` changed, and the
  Alpine and bench jobs only when the shell layer changed. SAFE DEFAULT: an unresolved
  diff base or any infra change runs everything, so detection can never hide a check.
- The startup-perf `bench` CI job is now an enforced regression gate
  (`CORE_BENCH_BUDGET_MS=120` over 50 warmed runs), not a report-only, continue-on-error
  step — a gross startup regression now fails the build instead of shipping silently.
- The pinned linter versions moved out of `ci.yml`'s `env:` block into
  `scripts/tool-versions.env`; CI loads them via a "Load pinned tool versions" step.
- Split `bin/` into shipped vs. tooling: `bin/` now holds only what is vendored into
  the OS repos (`clip`, `clip-paste`); the gate scripts moved to `scripts/`
  (`audit-core.sh`, `test-core.sh`, `bench-core.sh`, `sync-core.sh`,
  `update-plugins.sh`). The audit allowlists `scripts/` wholesale, so a new dev tool
  is covered the moment it lands. No consumer impact — those scripts were never in
  the manifest, so they were never vendored.
- `scripts/audit-core.sh` no longer uses the bash-4-only `mapfile`, so the gate itself
  runs on macOS's stock bash 3.2.
- The audit summary now NAMES the checks that skipped (tool absent) and labels such a
  run PARTIAL rather than hiding the gap behind a bare count — several skipped gates
  (markdownlint, actionlint, gitleaks, luacheck, nvim) are CI-enforced, so a clean local
  box can still differ from the gate.
- `core-doctor` now turns its `✗` tools into a copy-pasteable install line for this box's
  package manager, instead of leaving the reader to look each one up.
- Spinner (`_core_spin`) shows elapsed time and ends with a still `✓`/`✗` result frame, so
  a long step reads as progress and finishes with a legible outcome; `extract` routes the
  quiet unpack formats through it. Unknown-format `extract` errors print a what/why/fix block.
- `serve`/`up` suggest the nearest valid flag on an unknown option (did-you-mean).
- De-duplicated the gate scripts: the `_set_scope` area parser, the hermetic plugin-seed
  list, and the `ci-classify.sh` output reader now live once in `scripts/lib/common.sh`
  (consumed by `audit-core.sh`, `test-core.sh`, `bench-core.sh`) — they had drift-prone
  copies. `op.zsh` verbs gained the `emulate -L zsh` every other Core verb uses.

### Security

- Pinned the seven runtime zsh plugins to commit SHAs (`ZPLUGIN_PINS` in
  `zsh/plugins.zsh`) — the last unpinned link in a toolchain that already pins CI
  linters, pre-commit hooks, and GitHub Actions. An unpinned `master` clone fanned an
  upstream breaking change — or a compromised tag — out to all eight machines on the
  next install; installs now fetch exactly the pinned commit.

### Fixed

- `fbr`'s fzf preview used `{1}`, which on the current-branch row (`* main`) is the
  literal `*` — so the preview ran `git log *` and broke. It now lists clean branch
  names (`--format='%(refname:short)'`, `*/HEAD` dropped) and previews `{}`; a remote-only
  pick strips `origin/` on checkout to create the matching local tracking branch.
- `mkbak` could prompt or clobber: `cp -i` (from `aliases.zsh`, parsed first) bled into
  it, so a same-second second backup stopped for a y/n. It now picks the next free `.bak`
  suffix and copies via `command cp`, staying collision-safe and non-interactive.
- `_core_confirm`'s gum path defaulted to **Yes** while the `[y/N]` fallback defaulted to
  No — so the same destructive prompt (`please`/`up`/extract-overwrite) was one-Enter-to
  confirm under gum. It now passes `gum confirm --default=false`, a consistent safe default.
- The `_core-help` completion claimed "takes no arguments", but `core-help` accepts a
  `[filter]`; it now completes that filter with the verbs/sections the cheat sheet knows.
- `serve` now pre-checks the port is bindable (with `SO_REUSEADDR`, as `http.server`
  does) and fails in Core's voice instead of letting a taken port surface a Python traceback.
- `diff` was unconditionally aliased to `diff --color=auto`, which BSD/macOS `diff` (the
  dotfiles-MacBook target) does not support — every `diff` invocation would error there.
  The alias is now applied only after a feature-probe confirms this box's `diff` accepts it.
- fzf / fzf-tab previews hardcoded `bat`/`eza`, so every preview pane printed
  "command not found" on Debian/Ubuntu (bat ships as `batcat`) and on any box without
  eza. Previews now resolve `$BAT_BIN` with a `cat`/`ls` fallback, and a new audit
  section (`fzf preview binary resolution`) locks it so the regression can't recur.
- `fif`, `fbr`, and the Alt-Z zoxide-jump widget assumed `fzf`/`rg`/`git`/`zoxide`
  were present; they now degrade in Core's voice (`_core_err`/`_core_hint`) like `fcd`,
  instead of a raw "command not found".
- Removed leaked `</content>`/`</invoke>` template artifacts from the end of this
  changelog — the exact bug class the new markdown gate now catches.
- Restored non-executable mode (`100644`) on the twelve `zsh/*.zsh` modules. They
  are sourced, not executed, and had regressed to `100755`, failing the audit's
  exec-bit invariant — the exact bug class the audit exists to catch, fanning out
  to all eight OS repos.
- Registered `CODEOWNERS`, `dependabot.yml`, and `pull_request_template.md` in the
  audit's `META_ALLOWLIST` so the manifest reverse-drift scan accounts for them.
