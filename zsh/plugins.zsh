# core/zsh/plugins.zsh

# Lightweight zsh plugin loader — no Oh My Zsh, no Zinit. Plugins are auto-cloned
# to ${ZDOTDIR:-~/.config/zsh}/plugins on first launch (gitignored). Portable:
# needs git + network on first run only. Load AFTER fzf.zsh + bindings.zsh so the
# vi-mode init fires the binding hook with the widgets already defined, and AFTER
# options.zsh (which ran compinit — required by fzf-tab AND carapace).
#
# 2026 refresh:
#   • zsh-defer (romkatv) async-loads the two heaviest plugins (autosuggestions +
#     fast-syntax-highlighting) AFTER the first prompt paints — the shell is
#     interactive instantly and they "catch up" a few ms later.
#   • carapace (multi-shell completion, 500+ commands) feeds INTO fzf-tab.
#
# FORMATTER WARNING: the `(( $+functions[zsh-defer] ))` / `[fzf-tab-complete]`
# guards below MUST keep their hyphens un-spaced. A shell formatter (shfmt) that
# doesn't grok zsh will rewrite `[zsh-defer]` → `[zsh - defer]`, turning the
# associative-array key into an arithmetic expression that's always 0 — silently
# disabling deferral and the fzf-tab styling. Keep them exactly as written.

# ── Pinned plugin revisions ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# These plugins are the ONLY third-party CODE that runs in every interactive shell
# on every one of the 9 OS repos, yet they were the one thing this repo left
# UNPINNED while pinning its CI linters (ci.yml), pre-commit hooks (rev:), and even
# GitHub Actions by SHA. An unpinned `master` clone means an upstream breaking
# change — or a compromised tag — fans out to every machine on the next install.
# So pin each to a commit, exactly like the rest of the toolchain. Keyed by the
# FULL owner/name slug so `make update-plugins` (scripts/update-plugins.sh) can
# ls-remote each and rewrite the SHA deliberately — the runtime never floats.
# A plugin with no entry here falls back to the old floating `--depth=1` clone.

# widget, and the widget materialises right after the first prompt, long before
# you could press the key. So history-substring-search is deferred too: its
# history-substring-search-up/down widgets (Up/Down in bindings.zsh) only need to
# exist by keypress, and deferring takes its source cost off shell startup.
# NOTE: autosuggest-toggle (bound to Ctrl-\ in bindings.zsh) is bound
# UNCONDITIONALLY there for the same reason — a widget-exists guard at vi-mode
# init time would always be false and silently drop the bind.
