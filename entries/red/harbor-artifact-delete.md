Two supply-chain wins in one call: delete the known-good artifact so the trusted
baseline is gone (defenders can't diff the tampered layer against it) and so caches
miss and re-pull — resolving the tag to whatever you pushed last. Also used to remove
a temporarily-pushed malicious image once it has been pulled, erasing the evidence. A
`DELETE` on the artifact writes an `operation=delete` / `resource_type=artifact`
record. (Registry — no slots.)

```sh
# delete the trusted artifact by digest (or tag) via the Harbor API
curl -s -u <robot>:<secret> -X DELETE \
  "https://<registry>/api/v2.0/projects/<project>/repositories/<repo>/artifacts/<digest>"
```
