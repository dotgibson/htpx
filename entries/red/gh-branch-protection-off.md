Required reviews and status checks are the control that stops unreviewed code
reaching `main` (and the pipeline that deploys it). With admin, either delete the
rule outright, push, and (optionally) restore it — or leave it in place and use an
admin override to merge past it. Either path lands attacker code in the protected
branch; the first writes `protected_branch.destroy`, the second
`protected_branch.policy_override`. (Cloud CI — no slots.)

```sh
# delete protection on main, land code, then it can be re-created to cover tracks
gh api -X DELETE /repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/main/protection
# — or, as admin, bypass the policy on a single merge (protected_branch.policy_override):
gh pr merge <pr-number> --admin --merge
```
