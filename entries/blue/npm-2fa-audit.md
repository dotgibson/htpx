`action=package.edit` with the publish `mfa` requirement set to `none` is the invariant —
the publish protection being removed. Dropping require-2FA-to-publish is rare and high-impact
(it gates whether a bare token can ship a release), so any change to `none` warrants review,
especially one soon followed by a `package.publish`. Manage the publish-2FA requirement as a
locked package setting and alert on any downgrade; a disable-then-publish-then-re-enable is
the cover-tracks shape.

npm audit-log telemetry, companion-only — `PURPLE-TEAM.md` is on-prem Windows.
