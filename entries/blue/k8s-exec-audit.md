Every `kubectl exec`/`attach` is a `create` against the `pods/exec` (or
`pods/attach`) subresource in the audit log — that subresource *is* the invariant.
Routine in dev, but in production an exec by a human user (not a controller/service
account) is the hands-on-keyboard tell. Scope to production namespaces and alert on
interactive principals.

K8s audit telemetry, companion-only — `PURPLE-TEAM.md` is on-prem Windows.
