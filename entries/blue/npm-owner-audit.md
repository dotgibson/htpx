A `package.owner_add` (or org `team.user_add`) is the invariant — a new identity gaining
durable publish rights. Ownership changes are rare and map to a known onboarding, so one by
an unexpected actor, adding an unfamiliar account, or during an incident is the persistence
tell after a maintainer compromise. Reconcile new owners/maintainers against known
collaborators and alert on out-of-band grants; an owner_add followed by a publish is the
takeover-then-ship shape.

npm audit-log telemetry, companion-only — `PURPLE-TEAM.md` is on-prem Windows.
