`GRANT_DELEGATED_ADMIN_PRIVILEGES` (made super admin) and `ASSIGN_ROLE` (privileged role
assigned) in the **admin** audit are the invariants. Admin grants are rare and
high-impact, so one by an unexpected actor — especially super-admin, or a grant that
quickly follows a new-user creation — is the persistence tell after a tenant compromise.
Reconcile admin changes against the IdM workflow and alert on any outside change control.

Google Workspace audit-log telemetry, companion-only — `PURPLE-TEAM.md` is on-prem Windows.
