A forged TGT is minted offline, so the account uses Kerberos services (`4769` TGS
requests) without the DC ever issuing it a TGT (`4768`). Per account+host window,
a principal with TGS activity but zero TGT issuance is the invariant. Secondary
tells back it up: RC4 (`0x17`) when the realm is otherwise AES, and absurd ticket
lifetimes. Tune the window to your normal ticket-renewal cadence.

```spl
index=main EventCode IN (4768,4769) Account_Name!="*$"
| eval kind=if(EventCode==4768,"tgt","tgs")
| stats count(eval(kind=="tgt")) AS tgts count(eval(kind=="tgs")) AS tgs_reqs
    by Account_Name, Client_Address
| where tgs_reqs > 0 AND tgts == 0
```
