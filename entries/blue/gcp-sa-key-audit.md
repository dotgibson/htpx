User-managed SA keys are the durable GCP backdoor, so the invariant is the create
itself: `google.iam.admin.v1.CreateServiceAccountKey` in Cloud Audit Logs (Admin
Activity). Alert on creation for privileged SAs, by unexpected actors, or anywhere
org policy forbids user-managed keys. The org-policy constraint
`iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` turns this into prevention.

GCP Cloud Audit Logs telemetry (native Cloud Logging filter below; also queryable
as Sentinel `GCPAuditLogs`), companion-only — `PURPLE-TEAM.md` is on-prem Windows.

logName=~"cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity"
