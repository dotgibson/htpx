title: Detect cryptojacking (Stratum pool connections + CPU peg)

Two independent tells converge: a process pegged near 100% CPU for a sustained
period, and an outbound connection speaking Stratum to a mining pool — often on
3333/5555/7777/14444 or to a known pool domain, sometimes wrapped in TLS. Alert on
outbound connections to pool-domain/port indicators from server or workstation
fleets, and corroborate with EDR process telemetry for the CPU peg and miner
command-line flags (`--cpu-max-threads-hint`, `stratum+tcp://`). Either signal alone
is worth a look; together they're high fidelity.

```spl
index=zeek sourcetype=zeek:conn (id.resp_p IN (3333,5555,7777,14444) OR resp_domain IN ("*.pool.*","*xmr*","*minexmr*","*nanopool*"))
| stats count, sum(orig_bytes) as bytes_out, max(duration) as longest by id.orig_h, id.resp_h, id.resp_p
| where count>5
| sort - longest
```
