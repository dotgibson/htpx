`action=pref.two_factor_auth_changed` with the requirement set off (`two_factor_required=false`)
is the invariant — workspace-wide auth being weakened. Turning off enforced 2FA is rare and
high-impact (it drops every member to password-only), so any disable warrants review,
especially one paired with new logins or a fresh admin grant. Manage the 2FA policy as a
locked org setting and alert on any downgrade; a disable followed by anomalous sign-ins is the
takeover-enabling shape.

Slack audit-log telemetry, companion-only — `PURPLE-TEAM.md` is on-prem Windows.
