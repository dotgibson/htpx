`request.operation=delete` on a `sys/audit/` path is the invariant — the disable request
is logged before the device stops, so it's a reliable tripwire. Audit devices are
removed almost never outside planned maintenance, so treat any disable as high-severity,
alert in real time, and pair with a **heartbeat**: a gap in Vault audit volume right
after a `sys/audit` delete is the exfil-under-cover shape. Run more than one audit device
so disabling one doesn't go dark.

HashiCorp Vault audit-device telemetry, companion-only — `PURPLE-TEAM.md` is on-prem
Windows.
