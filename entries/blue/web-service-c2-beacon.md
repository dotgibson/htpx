The destination is trusted, so pivot off the *source process*, not the domain — a
domain allowlist just moves the goalposts to the next trusted SaaS (Discord,
Dropbox, Pastebin, Google Drive, Notion are all documented web-service C2). Sysmon
Event ID 3 attributes each outbound connection to its `Image`; browsers, mail
clients, Teams, and updaters talk to SaaS APIs — `powershell.exe`, `wscript.exe`, a
random binary in `%TEMP%`, or an Office child process beaconing to *any* SaaS API on
an interval does not. Gate on the process: exclude the known API-consumers, weight
images in user-writable paths (`\Users\`, `\AppData\`, `\Temp\`, `\ProgramData\`),
and alert when such a process makes repeated 443 connections to a host that is rare
*for that host*. The four domains below are a seed IOC list to triage first, **not**
the gate.

```spl
index=sysmon EventCode=3 Initiated=true DestinationPort=443
| search NOT (Image="*\\chrome.exe" OR Image="*\\msedge.exe" OR Image="*\\firefox.exe" OR Image="*\\Teams.exe" OR Image="*\\OneDrive.exe" OR Image="*\\outlook.exe" OR Image="*\\Dropbox.exe" OR Image="*\\slack.exe" OR Image="*\\Code.exe")
| eval user_writable=if(match(Image,"(?i)\\\\(Users|AppData|Temp|ProgramData|Public)\\\\"),1,0)
| bucket _time span=1h
| stats count as conns, dc(_time) as active_hours, values(DestinationHostname) as dests by host, Image, User, DestinationIp, user_writable
| where conns>3 AND active_hours>2
| sort -user_writable -conns
```

Seed list for a fast first triage (relabel, don't gate):
`api.telegram.org`, `*.slack.com`, `api.github.com`, `gist.githubusercontent.com`.
