The invariant is the Okta System Log event itself: `user.mfa.factor.reset_all` (or
a factor deactivate). Routine during genuine help-desk resets, so detect on the
correlation — a reset *not* tied to an approved ticket, or one immediately followed
by a new-factor enrollment plus a sign-in from a new device/geo.

Okta System Log telemetry (Splunk Okta add-on / Sentinel), companion-only —
`PURPLE-TEAM.md` is on-prem Windows.

```spl
index=okta sourcetype=OktaIM2:log eventType IN ("user.mfa.factor.reset_all","user.mfa.factor.deactivate")
| table _time, actor.alternateId, target{}.alternateId, client.ipAddress, client.geographicalContext.country
```
