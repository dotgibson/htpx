Device-code is a rare auth flow for normal interactive users, so the invariant is
the flow itself: filter Entra sign-in logs for `authenticationProtocol == deviceCode`,
then triage by user / IP / location / app. A device-code sign-in from a geo or IP
that doesn't match the user — or for a user who never uses it — is the tell.

This is **Entra sign-in telemetry (KQL / Sentinel), not the Windows Security log**,
so it lives only here in the companion — `PURPLE-TEAM.md` is scoped to on-prem
Splunk and deliberately doesn't carry cloud detections.

```kql
SigninLogs
| where AuthenticationProtocol == "deviceCode"
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, AppDisplayName, Location, ResultType
```
