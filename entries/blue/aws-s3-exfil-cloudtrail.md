title: Detect S3 bulk exfil (CloudTrail data events + access logs)
detection: splunk-cloudtrail
event_ids: []

  tactic: TA0009
  techniques: [T1530]
source: CloudTrail S3 data events; S3 server access logs
pair: aws-s3-mass-exfil

The invariant is *volume from one principal*: a burst of `GetObject` (or a
`CopyObject` whose destination bucket is outside the account) far above that
identity's baseline, usually preceded by a `ListObjects`/`ListBucket` sweep. Alert
on the per-principal object-read count over a short window, weighting a first-time
principal↔bucket pairing, a new source IP/role, and CopyObject to an unknown-account
`bucket`. Defend structurally with least-privilege bucket policies, VPC endpoint
restrictions, and Object Lock on the crown-jewel buckets.

> Caveat: `GetObject`/`ListObjects` are S3 **data events** — *not* logged by
> CloudTrail unless S3 data-event logging is enabled for the bucket (management
> events won't carry them). Where data events are off, fall back to **S3 server
> access logs** / CloudWatch `BytesDownloaded`. And `CopyObject` data events are
> recorded against the **destination** bucket — so a server-side copy into an
> attacker-owned bucket outside the account is a CloudTrail blind spot; catch that
> path on the *source* bucket's **S3 server access logs** (which record the copy's
> read) and the `GetObject`-volume signal above, not on destination data events.

CloudTrail telemetry (Splunk `aws:cloudtrail` / Athena / Sentinel
`AWSCloudTrail`), companion-only — `PURPLE-TEAM.md` is on-prem Windows.
