Adding a secret/cert to an app is a discrete Entra audit event — "Add service
principal credentials" / "Update application – Certificates and secrets
management". The invariant is the credential addition; triage by who did it, which
(privileged) app it targets, and whether it lines up with a normal app-lifecycle
change. A credential added to a high-privilege app by an unexpected actor — or one
with a long/odd validity window — is the tell.

This is **Entra audit telemetry (KQL / Sentinel), not the Windows Security log**,
so it lives only here in the companion — `PURPLE-TEAM.md` is scoped to on-prem
Splunk.
