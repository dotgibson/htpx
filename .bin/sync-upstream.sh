# sync-upstream.sh — push an OS repo's vendored `core/` subtree back upstream to
# dotfiles-core (the source of truth). Reached through the `gsync` alias
# (zsh/aliases.zsh resolves this file relative to itself, so the alias survives
# the core/ subtree vendoring — same trick maint.zsh uses).
#
# The subtree boundary is `core/` ⇄ dotfiles-core root@main: OS repos vendor ALL
# of Core under core/ via `git subtree add/pull --prefix=core <remote> main`
# (see scripts/sync-core.sh, scripts/new-os-repo.sh). So the only prefix that can
# round-trip back to dotfiles-core main is `core` — pushing a subdirectory like
# nvim/ would split a history with no common ancestor to main and be rejected.
