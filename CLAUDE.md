# CLAUDE.md — dotfiles-core

Project memory for Claude Code. This file is auto-loaded every session, so it is
the shared context that keeps every routine (and every ad-hoc edit) reasoning
from the system's real rules instead of guessing. Keep it short and true; when a
rule here drifts from `README.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md`, those win — fix this.

## What this repo is

`dotfiles-core` is the **single source of truth** for the Core layer of a
**nine-repo dotfiles system** built on a three-layer model. Core is authored
**once here** and vendored into each OS repo's `core/` via `git subtree` — so a
defect here fans out N-way. Treat every change as if it ships to all of them,
because it does.

| Layer         | Lives in                                                               | Examples                                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Core**      | **this repo**, vendored into each OS repo's `core/`                    | zsh modules, tmux, nvim, git, starship       |
| **OS-native** | `dotfiles-{MacBook,Windows,Debian,Fedora,Arch,openSUSE,Alpine,Gentoo}` | package manager, clipboard, paths            |
| **Role**      | `dotfiles-Kali`                                                        | offensive/engagement tooling on the OS layer |

Plus `dotfiles-web` — the public Astro showcase/docs site (the system's public
face, **not** a config layer). The canonical Core-vendoring fleet is
`scripts/os-repos.txt`; `dotfiles-Windows` is a machine repo but vendors no
`core/` (its host config is replicated from scratch in PowerShell, not ported).

## The rules that bite

- **Is it Core?** It belongs here **only** if it is identical on every machine
  **and** not OS-specific **and** not offensive. Changes with the OS → the OS
  repo. Changes with the operator → `dotfiles-Kali`. (See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.)
- **The manifest is the contract.** `core.manifest` is the canonical inventory.
  Adding a Core file means adding its path to `core.manifest` in the same change;
  `scripts/audit-core.sh` enforces this both directions. Repo-meta and dev tooling
  (docs, `.github/`, `.claude/`, `scripts/`) live in the audit's allowlist instead.
- **Never edit vendored `core/` in an OS repo.** That tree is a copy of this repo
  and is overwritten on the next sync. Fix it **here**, then fan out.
- **Load order is load-bearing.** `tools → ui → options → history → aliases → git
  → functions → fzf → bindings → plugins → op → maint → update → os → local`
  (the canonical order in `core.manifest`). Don't reorder casually.
- **Exec bits are asserted.** `bin/`, `scripts/`, `tmux/scripts/`, `maint/` runners
  are `+x`; the sourced `zsh/*.zsh` modules must stay non-executable.
- **A user-visible change lands in `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`** in the
  same commit, with a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  message (`type(scope): summary`).

## The one gate

`scripts/audit-core.sh` is the single definition of "Core is healthy" (manifest
drift, exec-bits, syntax, shellcheck, luacheck, markdownlint, behavioral suite).
CI, pre-commit, and `make audit` all call it. **Green it before you push** — a red
tree must never be vendored out.

```bash
make audit          # the full gate
make audit-changed  # only what your diff touches (fast loop)
make sync           # fan Core out to every OS repo (after a green audit)
```

Run `make` with no target for the discoverable list of entry points.

## Maintenance routines (`.claude/`)

On-demand routines that automate the judgment-heavy chores `audit-core.sh` can't:

- `/doc-audit` — cross-check prose against reality across the fleet (docs ↔
  manifest ↔ code ↔ each OS repo). Delegates to the `doc-consistency` subagent.
- `/tool-scout` — research the modern-CLI stack for newer/better tools and major
  features worth adopting. Delegates to the `tool-scout` subagent.
- `/freshness-triage` — review open dependency-bump PRs (zsh plugins, nvim lock,
  actions) against upstream changelogs and flag breaking changes.

Each routine **reports first** and only proposes changes; nothing is vendored out
without a green `make audit`.
