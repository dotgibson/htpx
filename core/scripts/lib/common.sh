# scripts/lib/common.sh — shared output helpers for the gate scripts.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ONE definition of the colour palette + pass/skip/fail/hdr/have that
# audit-core.sh, test-core.sh, bench-core.sh, sync-core.sh and update-plugins.sh
# all need — replacing five copy-pasted ~15-line blocks that could (and did) drift.
#
# This is a SOURCED library, not a runnable script — so, exactly like zsh/*.zsh, it
# carries NO shebang and stays mode 100644 (the audit's exec-bit section asserts
# this: scripts/lib/*.sh is the bash sibling of the sourced zsh modules). The
# `# shellcheck shell=bash` directive above keeps the linter in bash mode without a
# shebang. bash 3.2-safe (no associative arrays / mapfile) so it runs on macOS too.
#
# Usage (from any scripts/*.sh):
#   source "${BASH_SOURCE[0]%/*}/lib/common.sh"
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Idempotent: a second source is a no-op (a script + the audit both sourcing it,
# or future nesting, must not redefine or re-zero the counters).

# Palette. Coloured ONLY when stdout is a real terminal and NO_COLOR is unset
# (https://no-color.org) — so `make audit > log`, `| less`, or a captured CI run
# gets clean text instead of raw \e[..m escapes littering the file. This mirrors
# zsh/ui.zsh, which gates its runtime helpers the same way: ONE colour rule across
# the dev tooling and the shell layer. (fail() writes to stderr, but keying the whole
# palette on stdout keeps it simple and means a redirect strips every escape at once;
# a plain `2>&1 | tee log` therefore stays readable too.) Codes live here, once.
# CLICOLOR_FORCE keeps colour on even when stdout is NOT a tty — used when a parent
# captures a child's output to a file and re-prints it to a real terminal (audit-core.sh
# overlaps the behavioral suite this way). NO_COLOR still wins (https://no-color.org).
# Colour MODE, re-evaluable so a script's `--color WHEN` flag can override the default
# AFTER this lib is sourced (the gate scripts source common.sh before their arg loop).
#   auto   (default) — colour on a TTY (or CLICOLOR_FORCE), off when piped/redirected
#   always           — colour regardless of TTY (e.g. piping into `less -R`)
#   never            — never
# NO_COLOR (https://no-color.org) is a hard override-OFF that wins over `always`.
