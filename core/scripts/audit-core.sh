# THE AUDIT BUTTON — this repo's test suite.
#
# core.manifest calls itself "the contract. Audit scripts and the promotion
# checklist read it." This is that audit script. It verifies Core is internally
# consistent BEFORE it gets vendored (via scripts/sync-core.sh) into all 9 OS repos,
# where a defect would fan out N-way.
#
# Checks (each is a section; a failure in one does not abort the others):
#   1. manifest <-> filesystem drift   — every manifest path exists; every
#                                         tracked Core file is listed or allowlisted
#   2. executable-bit assertions       — *.sh and bin/clip* must be +x in the
#                                         git index; zsh/*.zsh must NOT be (sourced)
#   3. shell syntax                     — bash -n on bash scripts; zsh -n on zsh modules
#   4. lua                              — luacheck nvim/        (if luacheck present)
#   5. lint                             — shellcheck            (if present)
#  5c. Core⇄OS boundary                — no OS-absolute paths in portable zsh modules
#   6. config files                     — toml/yaml parse-check (if python3 present)
#   7. markdown                          — markdownlint (if markdownlint-cli2 present)
#   8. workflows                         — actionlint on .github/workflows (if present)
#  8b. secrets                           — gitleaks working-tree scan (if present)
#   9. version consistency              — pre-commit hook revs == tool-versions.env;
#                                         core.version SemVer + CHANGELOG coherence
#  10. behavioral                       — load-order smoke + function units (test-core.sh)
#
# We deliberately do NOT enforce shfmt: the hand-tuned scripts here use an
# intentional compact one-liner style that shfmt would expand. shellcheck (real
# bugs) is enforced; formatting is left to .editorconfig + the author's eye.
#
# Graceful degradation (mirrors zsh/tools.zsh): a missing linter is SKIPPED with
# a notice, never a failure — so this runs on a bare box AND in CI, where the
# tools are installed. Exit status is non-zero only on a real FAIL.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/audit-core.sh            # run every section
#   ./scripts/audit-core.sh --quiet    # only print SKIP/FAIL + the summary

THE audit button — manifest/exec-bit/syntax/lint/config/markdown/workflow/
version/behavioral checks. CI and pre-commit run this exact script.

  -q, --quiet     only print SKIP/FAIL lines and the final summary
  --json          emit a machine-readable summary object on stdout (implies --quiet):
                  {pass,skip,fail,seconds,strict,tool_skips,skipped[],result}. For CI
                  steps / editor integrations that want to parse, not scrape, the result.
  --strict        fail if any gate SKIPPED because its TOOL is absent — that gate did
                  not actually run, so a "green" with such skips is only PARTIAL. An
                  out-of-scope skip (a narrowed --scope/--changed run) is intentional and
                  does NOT trip --strict, so this is safe on a fully-provisioned CI leg
                  where every IN-SCOPE tool is installed. The summary names every skip.
  --scope LIST    limit the slow area-specific sections to a comma list:
                  shell, nvim, all (default), none. Cheap structural/config/
                  markdown/workflow/version checks always run. CI sets this from
                  scripts/ci-classify.sh; omit it locally to run the full audit.
  --color WHEN    auto (default) | always | never. `always` keeps colour when piped
                  (e.g. into `less -R`); NO_COLOR still wins. Also via CORE_COLOR env.
  --changed       derive the scope from your local git diff (working tree vs HEAD,
                  falling back to the branch delta vs the default branch) using the
                  SAME scripts/ci-classify.sh CI uses — so a docs- or nvim-only edit
                  skips the gates it can't affect, tightening the dev loop. Fails SAFE
                  to the full run when the diff can't be resolved. An explicit --scope
                  overrides this.
