# core/zsh/history.zsh
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Portable zsh history config. NEW in the 2026 refresh, and it matters even with
# atuin: atuin IMPORTS from and (by default) shadows zsh history, and
# zsh-history-substring-search (bound to the arrow keys in bindings.zsh) reads the
# in-memory history list — both need HISTFILE/SAVEHIST set sanely. Previously this
# lived (if at all) in each OS .zshrc; centralizing it here removes that drift.
#
# LOAD ORDER: source THIRD, after options.zsh, before aliases.zsh.
