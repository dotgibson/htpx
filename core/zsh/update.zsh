# "Tell me when there are updates, don't make me remember." A throttled,
# fully-backgrounded check on shell start that prints a single one-line nudge if
# packages are upgradable — then APPLYING is your call via `up`.
#
# WHY NOT update+upgrade on every shell:
#   • blocks every pane/split/sesh-session on a package sync (kills the startup
#     work in tools.zsh); concurrent shells deadlock on the dpkg/rpm lock
#   • needs root on every shell (password prompt, or passwordless sudo = privesc)
#   • unattended `-y` upgrades are dangerous on Arch (partial-upgrade breakage),
#     Gentoo (multi-hour compiles), and Kali (engagement reproducibility)
#   • hangs when offline
# So: this CHECKS (no root, backgrounded, throttled to once/day) and NUDGES. The
# real upgrade is `up` (interactive) or an OS-layer timer — see the tail comment.
#
# LOAD ORDER: source near the END of your loader (after `plugins`), so the notice
# prints just above your first prompt.
#
# Config (override in os/local before this is sourced):
#   UPDATE_CHECK_ENABLED   1        # set 0 to disable the check entirely (e.g. Kali during ops)
#   UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL  86400    # seconds between background checks
