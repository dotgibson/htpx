# companion — structured, ATT&CK-tagged, red↔blue-paired pentest reference

Restructures the offensive corpus into machine-readable entries so the same
content can be **searched, ATT&CK-tagged, target-substituted, and paired with its
blue detection** — the shape a standalone terminal companion would take.

For the paired red↔blue **attack/detection slice it covers, the entries are the
source of truth**: where they overlap `hacktheplanet` / `PURPLE-TEAM.md`, the flat
files' blocks are *generated* from the entries (inside `companion:gen` markers) and
CI rejects drift. Everything those flat files hold that *isn't* a clean paired
attack — the tradecraft prose, dorks, multi-step chains — stays hand-authored and
canonical there. See *Source of truth* below for the full model.

## What's here

```
companion/
├── htpx                     # fzf browser: search → preview attack + its detection → fill slots → clip
├── gen-views.sh             # render entry-backed blocks into the flat views (+ --check drift gate)
└── entries/
    ├── red/*.md             # attacks   (frontmatter + command template)
    └── blue/*.md            # detections (frontmatter + SPL), paired back to red
```

## The entry schema (Markdown + YAML frontmatter)

Typed metadata up top (greppable, `yq`-queryable); raw copy-paste content in the
body (renders in `bat`/`glow`, `rg`-searchable). One file per entry.

```yaml
id:         stable kebab key
title:      human label
section:    matches a hacktheplanet fold name
phase:      engagement phase
attack:     { tactic: TA0006, techniques: [T1558.003] }   # MITRE ATT&CK
platform:   [windows, linux, network]
source:     citation
pair:       <id of the paired entry in the other colour>  # or null
```

Command templates normalize the corpus's `<angle-bracket>` placeholders to
`{{slots}}` (`{{rhost}}`, `{{lhost}}`, `{{user}}`, `{{password}}`, `{{domain}}`,
`{{hostname}}`, `{{nthash}}`, `{{port}}`, `{{share}}`).

## Using it

```sh
export RHOST=10.10.10.5 DOMAIN=corp.local USER_T=svc_sql PASS='…'
htpx            # pick an attack; preview shows it + its blue detection;
                # the command is slot-filled and copied via `clip`
```

`htpx` is on the shell as of bootstrap: `companion/` symlinks to `~/companion`
and `offensive.zsh` defines an `htpx` function. From a checkout you can also run
`./htpx` directly. It needs `fzf`; `bat` (preview) and `clip` (Core clipboard)
are used if present, else it falls back to `cat`/stdout. No `yq` dependency —
`htpx` reads only the scalar top-level fields it needs (`title:`, `pair:`) from
the frontmatter with `awk` (the nested `attack:` block is for humans/greppers).

## The differentiator

The `pair:` field makes the **purple pivot** nearly free: selecting an attack
previews its detection right beside it (see Kerberoast ↔ `4769`, DCSync ↔ `4662`).
No mainstream tool ships attacks paired with the telemetry they trip.

## Corpus

8 paired concepts + 1 unpaired recon entry (SMB enum), spanning Credential
Access, Lateral Movement, and Discovery:

| Attack (red) | Detection (blue) | ATT&CK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kerberoast SPNs | `4769` RC4 TGS | T1558.003 |
| AS-REP roast | `4771` pre-auth `0x18` | T1558.004 |
| Password spray (kerbrute) | `4625` one source, many accounts | T1110.003 |
| DCSync | `4662` replication | T1003.006 |
| Pass-the-hash lateral | `4624` type-3 fan-out | T1550.002 |
| NTLM relay | `4624` workstation mismatch | T1557.001 |
| Coerce DC (PetitPotam/printerbug) | `5145` named-pipe access | T1187 |
| AD CS ESC1 (certipy) | `4886` SAN mismatch | T1649 |

Growth is mechanical now that the drift gate exists: author the red+blue entry
pair, mark the matching flat blocks (blue into `PURPLE-TEAM.md`; red into
`hacktheplanet` *only when the command is atomic and slot-mappable*), then
`gen-views.sh`. Rich multi-step red chains (relay, coercion, AD CS) stay
hand-authored in `hacktheplanet` — the entry still powers `htpx` and the paired
preview.

## Source of truth (decided — the hybrid)

The "do the entries become canonical?" question is **resolved**, but not as the
original binary. `hacktheplanet` is 489 lines and most of it is *tradecraft prose*
— dorks, enum sequencing, conditional advice, warnings — that doesn't fit the
entry schema; generating the whole file from rigid entries would either lose that
prose or bloat the schema into freeform markdown. So:

- **Entries are canonical for the paired red↔blue attack/detection slice only.**
  That's the part that genuinely *is* `{id, title, attack, command}`-shaped and
  benefits from ATT&CK tags, slot-fill, and the purple pivot.
- **The flat files stay canonical for everything else** — the prose the schema
  can't hold.
- **Where they overlap, the entry wins via generation.** A flat file opts a block
  in with `companion:gen ID` … `companion:end ID` markers — HTML comments in
  markdown (`PURPLE-TEAM.md`), `#` comments in the shell-style `hacktheplanet`.
  `gen-views.sh` regenerates the marked blocks from the entry, and
  `gen-views.sh --check` (run in CI, `.github/workflows/companion.yml`) fails on
  drift. Content outside the markers is never touched.

This kills drift on the overlap *without* a 60-entry migration and *without*
giving up the rich prose. Workflow: edit the entry → `gen-views.sh` → commit both.

**Both sides are wired.** The render shape keys off the entry's colour:

- **Blue** (`PURPLE-TEAM.md`) — `**title**` + prose + a fenced `spl` detection
  block. Its SPL has no target slots, so no placeholder translation.
- **Red** (`hacktheplanet`) — just the raw command lines in that file's terse,
  command-first house style, with the entry's `{{slots}}` reverse-mapped to its
  `<angle-bracket>` vocabulary (`{{rhost}}`→`<ip_address>`, `{{nthash}}`→`<NThash>`,
  …; see `SLOT_TO_ANGLE` in `gen-views.sh`). Only attacks whose commands are
  contiguous and map cleanly are marked (Kerberoast, AS-REP, DCSync); ones whose
  lines are scattered across folds or carry inline notes (SMB enum, pass-the-hash)
  stay hand-authored — the entry owns only what it cleanly owns.

## Open decisions (before this graduates from MVP)

1. **ATT&CK tagging is 100% manual** — neither source carries technique IDs today.
   Tagging both colours with the *same* technique IDs turns `pair:` into a
   derivable join (not just a hand-kept link).
2. **Standalone vs in-repo.** If this grows real tooling it likely wants its own
   repo (installable independent of the dotfiles); for now it lives in the Kali
   role layer where the content already is.
