# offensive/companion/gen-views.sh — render entry-backed blocks into the flat views.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The source-of-truth bridge. The structured `entries/` are CANONICAL for the
# paired red<->blue attack/detection slice; the flat field references
# (`PURPLE-TEAM.md`, later `hacktheplanet`) stay canonical for everything else —
# the tradecraft prose, dorks, sequencing, warnings that don't fit the entry
# schema. Where the two OVERLAP, this script makes the entry win: it regenerates
# the marked blocks in the flat file FROM the entry, so the overlap can't drift.
#
# A flat file opts a block in with a marker pair naming the entry id, in the host
# file's comment style — HTML for markdown, `#` for the shell-style hacktheplanet:
#
#     <!-- companion:gen kerberoasting-4769 -->   (PURPLE-TEAM.md, a blue detection)
#     …generated from entries/blue/kerberoasting-4769.md…
#     <!-- companion:end kerberoasting-4769 -->
#
#     # companion:gen kerberoast-getuserspns      (hacktheplanet, a red attack)
#     …generated from entries/red/kerberoast-getuserspns.md…
#     # companion:end kerberoast-getuserspns
#
# Anything OUTSIDE the markers is hand-authored and never touched.
#
#   gen-views.sh            # rewrite every marked block in place from its entry
#   gen-views.sh --check    # exit 1 (with a diff) if any block is out of date
#
# --check is the drift gate (CI runs it); the bare form is what you run after
# editing an entry. The render shape is keyed off the entry's colour: a BLUE entry
# renders as `**title**` + prose + a fenced ```spl detection; a RED entry renders
# as its raw command lines with the `{{slot}}` placeholders reverse-mapped to
# hacktheplanet's `<angle-bracket>` house style (see SLOT_TO_ANGLE).
