-- TITLE : nvim-treesitter-context | sticky context header (function/class you're inside)
-- LINKS : https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-context
-- ABOUT : Pins the enclosing scope (the def/if/for you're currently inside) to the top of the
--         window as you scroll past it — the lightweight, in-window cousin of breadcrumbs. Reads
--         from the treesitter trees you already parse (nvim-treesitter.lua), so it "just works"
--         for every language with a parser and adds no parsing cost of its own.
-- LAZY  : event = BufReadPost/BufNewFile (matches treesitter's own trigger). `[c` jumps UP to the
--         context line — chosen because hlsearch is off and you navigate diffs via ]h/[h, so the
--         native ]c/[c change-motions are free outside diff buffers.
