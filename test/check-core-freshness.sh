# test/check-core-freshness.sh — is the vendored core/ subtree BEHIND upstream?
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The vendored core/ here is a git-subtree copy of dotfiles-core. Nothing on THIS
# side tracked whether that copy had fallen behind upstream — so a security/bugfix
# landing in Core could sit un-pulled here indefinitely. This is the consumer-side
# freshness watcher: it asks whether the vendored commit is now BEHIND upstream's
# tip, i.e. there are Core updates this repo hasn't pulled. A behind result is the
# NUDGE to run a `git subtree pull`, not a hard error in normal development — so it
# lives in a SCHEDULED workflow.
#
# Exit codes (matching dotfiles-core's drift-check convention — see
# core/scripts/update-plugins.sh --check):
#   0  current, OR a graceful skip (no git, offline/restricted, not a subtree checkout)
#   2  vendored core/ is BEHIND upstream (drift — the nudge to `git subtree pull`)
#   1  a genuine hard failure (e.g. a malformed core.lock)
# The workflow branches on these so a skip, a drift, and a real error each render the
# right step summary. Override the upstream/branch with CORE_UPSTREAM / CORE_BRANCH.
